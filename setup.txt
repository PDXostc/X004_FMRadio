Following are the recommended steps for setuping development environment prior to building and running FMRadioService/FMRadioExtension/DNA_FMRadio

Build environment: Tested on Ubuntu 14.10

The .gbs.conf file in your home directory must contain this line in the [repo.tizen_latest] heading:
url = http://download.tizen.org/releases/milestone/tizen/ivi/tizen_20140422.1/repos/ivi/ia32/packages

An example .gbs-conf file is in this project's root directory.


STEPS SETUP
*************************************
In a shell:

*** on TARGET DEVICE ***

  * Make sure your FM radio dongle is up and running
        * For example, when using the R820T SDR&DVB-T from NooElec, do :

        $ sudo cp blacklist-rtlsdr.conf /etc/modprobe.d
        $ sudo cp 99-librtlsdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

  * Make sure your tizen setup supports touch events
    (DO NOT DO this step if your touchscreen already works properly)

        * Check your touchscreen's idVendor and idProduct in :

                $ lsusb -v

        * Check which DISPLAY port you are currently using (the actual
          physical port in which your monitor is plugged in). This is
          typically 'VGA', 'HDMI1', 'HDMI2', etc... You can check the
          different known ports in : /etc/xdg/weston/weston.ini

        * Edit the following .rules file with corresponding info.
          Change idVendor, idProduct and <DPY_NAME> with the correct values

                $ vim 99-touchscreen.rules

        * Copy the .rules files in proper location on target device

                $ sudo cp 99-touchscreen.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

  * reboot the device
        $ sudo reboot
